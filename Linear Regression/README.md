# Python - Linear Regression 

Project demonstration of applying linear regression in Python

## Installation

- Make sure you have Python 3.3 version at least to run this project

- Create a virtual environment for the development (make sure you have third librairies that handle .sh file like [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) or [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you are on Windows based system)
```bash
    cd project-directory
    sh start_env.sh
```
It will help us manage the dependencies through the project without affecting the system already installed librairies
- Activate the virtual environment by running these script
    - For Windows system
        ```bash
            source ./vdev/Scripts/activate
        ```
    - Else for Mac or Linux
        ```bash
            source ./vdev/bin/activate
        ```
- Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the project dependencies.

```bash
    pip install -r dependencies.txt
```
